=============
Installation
=============
Before installing MISPR, you need to follow the steps below in order:

1. (Optional) Create a :ref:`installation/dependencies:Conda environment`
2. Make sure you have access to the :ref:`computational chemistry software dependencies <chem-software-deps>`
   needed to run the DFT and MD simulations
3. Install :ref:`python package dependencies <py-package-deps>`
4. Set up :ref:`installation/dependencies:MongoDB` database
5. :ref:`Install MISPR <installation/index:Installing MISPR>`
6. Prepare the :doc:`configuration files <configuration>`
7. :doc:`Run a test workflow <test>`

.. note::
   Throughout the installation instructions, it is assumed that you are
   familiar with Python and with basic Linux shell commands. If not,
   `Linux Journey <https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell>`_ and
   `Python For Beginners <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_
   are some recommended starting points.

Installing MISPR
--------------------------------
MISPR can be installed either from the python package
index (good for most users) or directly from its GitHub
repository (good for developers).

Installation Method 1: Using pip
================================
For most users, install directly from PyPI: 

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mispr

Installation Method 2: Development mode
=======================================

.. _codes-develop-mode:

For developers or users who need to modify the source code, install MISPR in development mode. 

.. note::
   If you had already installed MISPR via pip or conda, you
   should uninstall that first before starting the installation in
   development mode. This ensures that you will not have any conflicts
   resulting from two different code installations.

The steps for installing the package in development mode are below.

1. Activate your conda environment or virtual environment

2. Create a ``codes`` directory in ``|CODES_DIR|``

3. ``cd`` to your newly created ``|CODES_DIR|/codes`` directory

4. Clone the package you want to install in development mode using git::

    git clone https://github.com/molmd/mispr.git

   Now you should have mispr directory in your ``codes``
   directory.

5. ``cd`` into the mispr directory and run
   ``pip install -e .`` or use the ``conda`` equivalent. Once installed,
   if you make changes to the code, the changes
   will take effect immediately without having to reinstall the package.

Post-installation
-------------------------
1. Before you go any further, confirm your package installations are correct.
   First start IPython by typing ``ipython`` in your terminal, then confirm that
   the command ``import mispr`` executes without any errors

2. To update the mispr code later on, execute ``git pull`` followed by
   ``pip install -e .`` or the ``conda`` equivalent in the mispr directory. 
   If you installed via pip, you can simply execute ``pip install --upgrade mispr``.
